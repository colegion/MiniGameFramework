Mini Game Framework â€“ Link & Pisti
This project is a modular mini-game framework containing two games:

Link Game: A match-based puzzle inspired by Wonder Link, with level targets and a built-in level editor.

Pisti Card Game: A classic card game with three difficulty settings: Easy, Medium, and Hard.

Recommended Start
Begin by opening the MainMenu scene. From there, you can access both games and the level editor.

Architecture Highlights
Uses SOLID principles to ensure modularity and maintainability.

Built around reusable systems:

GamePool & PoolController for efficient object reuse.

A generic GameController that governs game logic.

IGameContext interface allows plug-and-play rule definitions.

Scene-specific Bootstrappers handle dependency injection and setup.

Link Game Features
Level Editor: Easily design new levels in the LevelEditor scene. Press P to test instantly.

Link Searcher: Automatically finds valid links or shuffles the board if none are found.

Save & Load System: Robust support for tracking level progress.

Test Coverage: Includes both edit mode and play mode tests for reliability.

Known Issues
Switching game modes while animations (especially DOTween) are running can throw errors.

Save/load support is limited to the Link Game for now.
